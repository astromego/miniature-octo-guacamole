        <h1>Much Ado About Meghan.</h1>

    <p> I'm a Virgo and I love dinosaurs. Mother to two furboys; a dog called Murphy and a cat named Rogan (after Joe Rogan before anyone asks.) I'm fanatical about knitwear. </p>
            
    <p>I'm a massive nerd. I love literature and space and science, fact or fiction! I'm really bad at the ukulele but really good at deadlifts. I can never decide on a favourite colour and I love big earrings, tea and bumblebees!</p>

    <h2>Once Upon A Time...</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the countryside near Newry at the foot of the Mournes. I've always loved urban landscapes as much as the mountains and moved to Belfast shortly before my 19th birthday. I studied a HND in animation for a year before having an epiphany that I really, really didn't want to be an animator.</p>
    
    <p>So I applied for a Foundation Degree in Interactive Design at NRC Newtownabbey and never looked back. It was the best choice I've made in my academic life and I wouldn't be in the field I'm in without it.</p>
    
    <p>I'm currently in Year 2 of BDes Interaction Design at Belfast School of Art. Living the dream.</p>
